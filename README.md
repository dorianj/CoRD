# CoRD: Simple RDP Remote Desktop
Macs interact well with Windows, and with CoRD the experience is a bit smoother. Great for working on the office terminal server, administrating servers or any other time you'd like your PC to be a bit closer without leaving your Mac.

CoRD allows you to view each session in its own window, or save space with all sessions in one window. Scale session windows to whatever size fits you – the screen is resized automatically. Enter full screen mode and feel like you're actually at the computer. The clipboard is automatically synchronized between CoRD and the server.

For system administrators, CoRD creates a simpler workflow by allowing you to save server information, then quickly connect to that server by using HotKeys or the server drawer. This makes quickly connecting to a specific server easy, even when managing many servers.

Development has been slow on CoRD for a long time. Eventually, we will be transition to FreeRDP and development will speed up after that transition. Sorry, no timetables at the moment.
